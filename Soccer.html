        <h1> The Greastest Sport of All</h1>
        
        <p class = "first-paragraph">Soccer is one of,if not the greatest sport in the world.

        <p class = "second-paragraph"> There are many different leagues inside the sport.
            To name a few: Barclays, La Liga, and Major League Soccer.
            There are also many famous players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar Jr., Zlatan Ibrahimovic,
            Lionel Messi, Gareth Bale, and hundreds more. Most people believe that soccer is very boring 
            to watch, I can understand why people thimk that, but this causes people to think the sport 
            is boring all together. It may be boring to watch, but it isn't boring to play. </p>
